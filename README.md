# Interactive Pricing Component | Frontend Mentor

This is my solution to the interactive pricing component challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io). I did this project with React and Sass.

For this project I needed to have a custom range selection input, and I found out that there are different ways to do this for each browser. There isn't an easy way to change the color of the range progress on Chromium based browsers like there is on Firefox, so I didn't do it. I really wish there was one standard way to do something like this so people like me don't have to waste their time getting sliders to look good on every browser.

I also needed to bind the values of a switch and the slider to showing the price and pageviews. This was relatively simple, although I don't like the amount of times I need to use `useState` and I don't know what to do about that.

Overall, I feel way more confident with both React and Sass after this project. I will definitely be using both more.
